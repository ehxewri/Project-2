# Project 2: Machine Learning Application

## Overview
For Project 2, your group will tackle a problem using machine learning (ML), combined with other technologies you've learned. This project involves finding a dataset, choosing an ML model, and applying your knowledge to solve, analyze, or visualize the chosen problem.

### Project Objectives:
- **Find a Problem**: Identify a significant issue that can be addressed with ML.
- **Dataset Requirements**: Utilize a dataset with at least 500 records. For decision tree/random forest models, at least 1,000 records are required.
- **ML Model**: Implement either a supervised or unsupervised model.
- **Evaluation**: Assess your model using testing data, incorporating necessary metrics and visualizations.
- **Technologies**: Mandatory use of Scikit-learn and at least three of the following:
  - API requests
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas
  - Pandas plotting
  - Prophet
  - Python
  - Time series analysis

## Industry Focus Examples
- **Finance**:
  - Predict personal loan eligibility based on credit scores.
  - Develop a chatbot using natural language processing for customer assistance.
  - Predict consumer spending trends.
  - Image classifier for property valuation.
  
- **Healthcare**:
  - Predict disease risk from symptoms.
  - Image classifier for skin health.
  - Chatbot to connect patients and doctors.
  - Predict inherited illnesses from patient history.

- **Custom Applications**:
  - Utilize ML in any industry to create innovative solutions, such as data deep dives, smart interfaces, or predictive models.

## Collaboration Guidelines
- **Communication**: Establish clear communication channels (e.g., Slack, phone).
- **Project Management**: Use GitHub Projects to track tasks and milestones.
- **Milestones**: Set internal deadlines for phases like ideation, data fetching, analysis, and documentation.

## Support and Resources
- **Guidance**: Leverage support from instructional teams during classes and office hours.
- **Assistance**: Utilize learning assistants and tutors as needed.

## Project Requirements

### GitHub Documentation (25 points)
- **Repository Management**: Maintain a clean GitHub repository with a functional .gitignore. (10 points)
- **README**: Ensure the README is comprehensive and well-presented. (15 points)

### Presentation (25 points)
- **Coverage**: Include an executive summary, data handling, approach, and additional insights.
- **Professionalism**: Ensure slides are clean and professional. (5 points)

## Grading Scale
| Grade | Points |
|-------|--------|
| A     | 90+    |
| B     | 80-89  |
